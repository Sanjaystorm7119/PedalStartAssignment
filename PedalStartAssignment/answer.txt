4) if you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you
will choose as your partner and why?

I've known several people but if I happen to choose 2 people from my batch, they'd be thada and roop. Not only are they skilled and knowledgeable but also dedicated toward their assigned tasks. They remain accountable of their actions and also help their peers in understanding certain topics that they find difficult to comprehend.
